# iRos2024 Temperature data analysis

This folder contains a `MATLAB` program useful for analyzing motor temperature data coming from `ergoCub SN002` dumped during a demo at `iRos2024` while the robot was walking. Those data are available in the folder `data\motorTemperaturesiRos` and they have been collected using the [YarpRobotLoggerDevice](https://github.com/ami-iit/bipedal-locomotion-framework/tree/master/devices/YarpRobotLoggerDevice) developed by `AMI team`.
