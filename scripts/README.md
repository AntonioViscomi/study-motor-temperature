# Temperature data analysis scripts

This folder `scripts` contains some `MATLAB` scripts, which are useful for plotting motor temperature data collected using the `yarpdatadumper` plugin.

The scripts are ready to be used with data gathered using different setups:

- `plot_legs_temperatures.m` is used when the user dumps the data from all the joints of the robot legs
- `plot_single_joint_temperatures.m` is used when the user dumps the data from a single joint setup, similar to the one that is commonly used in the lab
- `plot_leg_subset_temperatures.m` is used when the user dumps the data from a subset of the robot leg joints, such as when we are collecting data from just the ankle of the robot.

In order to correctly use the script, one should have `MATLAB` installed and in the first section of the code it is mandatory to edit the name of the path of the uncompressed folder that contains the `data.log` and `info.log` files, generated by the `yarpdatadumper` plugin. 
One that is done, the script can be fully run and at the end of the execution it will generate graphs with the values of the temperatures dumped and a table, which is shown in the `Command Window`, showing the percentage of erroneous readings on the total of the data read.

In the `dumping` folder there are compressed data previously dumped that can be useful to check how the procedure works.
